  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <article class="about">
    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a late 80's native of Joburg, South Africa, with a decade of
      client-focused experience in the insurance industry, now diving headfirst
      into web development.

    <p>
      My journey may be non-linear, but every step has equipped me with valuable
      skills. Here's how my past fuels my passion for the web:
    </p>
    <ul class="skills">
      <li>
        <strong>Client-Centric Mindset:</strong>
        <p>
          I understand that websites are not just for developers â€“ they're for
          users. My background in client relations ensures I keep user needs at
          the heart of every project.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Problem-Solving:</strong>
        <p>
          From resolving complex disputes to debugging code, I thrive on turning
          challenges into solutions. My calm, analytical approach helps me
          tackle any hurdle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear & Concise Communicator:</strong>
        <p>
          I communicate complex ideas simply and effectively, making sure
          everyone's on the same page â€“ from clients to team members.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a junior web developer, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a unique
      perspective to your team. I'm eager to learn, grow, and contribute to your
      projects. I'm eager to learn from more experienced developers.

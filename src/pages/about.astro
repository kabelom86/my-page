    <p>Thanks for coming to visit.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a late 80's boy and a 'junior' when it comes to web development. The
      creative side of me acknowledges that my ideas need to be put onto
      screens, and in particular, the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend to use this page to display my techincal growth as well as my
      learnings, and I hope you'll like what you see. I'm keen on working full
      time as a frontend developer so I can learn and grow with likeminded
      peers.
